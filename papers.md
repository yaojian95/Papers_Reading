#### 2021-1-7 [Neutrinos from Beta Processes in a Presupernova: Probing the Isotopic Evolution of a Massive Star](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa95c4)

In a star's interior, neutrinos are produced via a number of thermal processes—mostly pair production—and via _β_-processes, i.e., electron/positron captures on nuclei and nuclear decay.

#### 2021-1-8 [Reconstructing Patchy Reionization with Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01214.pdf)
1. Secondary anisotropies of CMB :weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structure,the various manifestations of the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect, the integrated Sachs-Wolfe and Rees-Sciama effects, characterizing how time-dependent gravitational potentials alter the energy of CMB photons; and the moving lens effect, where the transverse motion of massive objects imprints temperature fluctuations on the CMB.
