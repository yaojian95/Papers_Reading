#### 2021-1-7 [Neutrinos from Beta Processes in a Presupernova: Probing the Isotopic Evolution of a Massive Star](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa95c4)

In a star's interior, neutrinos are produced via a number of thermal processes—mostly pair production—and via _β_-processes, i.e., electron/positron captures on nuclei and nuclear decay.

1. Secondary anisotropies of CMB :weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structure,the various manifestations of the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect, which describe Compton scattering of CMB photons with free electrons in galaxy clusters and the intergalactic medium,the integrated Sachs-Wolfe and Rees-Sciama effects, characterizing how time-dependent gravitational potentials alter the energy of CMB photons; and the moving lens effect, where the transverse motion of massive objects imprints temperature fluctuations on the CMB.
2. Delensing.Delensing the CMB is useful beyond the benefits it provides for primordial gravitational wave searches. For example, delensing the temperature and E-mode polarization leads to sharper peaks in the power spectra, allowing for a better determination of parameters which impact peak positions. Delensing can also reduce the off-diagonal covariance induced by lensing  and thereby improve the sensitivity of the CMB to other effects, such as primordial non-Gaussianity.
3. Reionization, the process by which the neutral gas filling the Universe became ionized by the first stars and galaxies between redshifts of about 20 and 6, was a complex and non-uniform process. The spatial variations or patchiness in the process of reionization leads to effects on the observed CMB temperature and polarization. **Patchy reionization** can produce B-mode polarization, either by the modulation of E-mode polarization or by scattering of remote temperature quadrupoles, and these secondary B modes can potentially act as a source of confusion in searches for primordial gravitational waves.
4. Quadratic estimator. While the quadratic estimator works well with current data, it will be sub-optimal at the sensitivity anticipated in the next generation of CMB surveys. One reason for this is that higher order effects of the sources of secondary anisotropies become too important to ignore in very high fidelity CMB maps, and use of the quadratic estimator results in an estimate of the distortion field whose variance is limited by secondary anistropies rather than by instrumental noise.
