#### 2-2 [Delensing the CMB with the cosmic infrared background: the impact of foregrounds](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01045.pdf)
The most promising avenue for detecting primordial gravitational waves from cosmic inflation is through measurements of degree-scale CMB ùêµ-mode polarisation. This approach must face the challenge posed by gravitational lensing of the CMB, which obscures the signal of interest. Fortunately, the lensing effects can be partially removed by combining high-resolution ùê∏-mode measurements with an **estimate of the projected matter distribution**. For near-future experiments, the best estimate of the latter **will arise from co-adding internal reconstructions (derived from the CMB itself) with external tracers of the large-scale structure such as galaxy surveys and the cosmic infrared background (CIB)**.

In recent years, one tracer has emerged as being particularly useful for delensing ‚Äì the cosmic infrared background (CIB). 
- The CIB is the integrated emission from dust heated by UV starlight in faraway, star-forming galaxies. 

It originates from a broad redshift range centred around ùëß ‚âà 1‚Äì2, though extending as far back as ùëß $\sim$ 4 (B√©thermin et al. 2012; Viero et al. 2013a,b). This distribution overlaps extensively with the lenses responsible for CMB lensing; so much so that the CIB and CMB lensing convergence are up to 80 % correlated (Song et al. 2003; Holder et al. 2013; Planck Collaboration 2014b). The constituent dust is at a temperature of a few tens of Kelvin so CIB emission peaks in the sub-millimetre part of the electromagnetic spectrum, where it was first detected by Puget et al. (1996), and dominates over other components (at least at high Galactic latitudes) in the high-frequency channels of CMB experiments, with lower frequencies probing higher-redshift sources.

#### 1-31 Dust and gas as obscuring medium.(from review paper, Obscured Active Galactic  Nuclei)
The obscuring medium is typically composed of dust and/or gas. **Dust** is the common term used  to describe solid-state structures, which are typically carbonaceous grains and amorphous silicate grains (for a review, see Draine 2003). **Gas** is the term used to describe a broad range of gaseous states, from fully ionized gas, including electrons and protons, to neutral gas and molecular compounds. Dust is the dominant source of obscuration at UV‚ÄìIR wavelengths, while gas dominates the absorption at X-ray energies. The impact of the obscuring material on the detection of the accretion-disk emission is dependent on the wavelength.

#### 1-29 [Quadratic estimators for CMB weak lensing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.12193.pdf)

The prime target of CMB lensing surveys is the lensing potential, which is reconstructed from the observed CMB temperature T and polarization E and B fields. Until very recently, this reconstruction has been performed with quadratic estimators (QEs), which, although known to be suboptimal for high-sensitivity experiments, are numerically efficient, and useful to make forecasts and cross-check the results of more sophisticated likelihood-based methods.

global-minimum-variance (GMV): HO02 estimator is suboptimal to the GMV estimator, with a reconstruction noise larger by up to ‚àº 9% for a SO-like experiment.

####  [Continuity eq., Euler eq., Poisson eq. and EOS](https://www.astro.rug.nl/~weygaert/tim1publication/lss2009/lss2009.linperturb.pdf)
The evolution of a fluid is dictated by three fluid equations. The **continuity equation** or energy equation describes the conservation of energy (mass). The **Euler equation** is the force-law describing the acceleration of the fluid elements as a result of the gravitational force and pressure (gradient) in the fluid. The sources for the gravitational field are specified by the **Poisson** equation. The prevailing pressure of a medium is obtained through the **equation of state**, specifying the nature of the cosmic fluid.In the following we will introduce these equations.
#### Energy momentum tensor: density and flow of energy and momentum are combined into energy-momentum tensor.

Continuity equation(conservation of energy (or, momentum)):
$$\frac{\partial{\rho}}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \vec J = 0$$
set $P^0 = \rho, P^{1,2,3} = J^{1,2,3}, x^{\mu} = \{t, x^1,x^2,x^3\}$, we have 
$$\frac{\partial P^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\mu}} = 0.$$
And we can genaralize to add **momentum** component, and to tensorial form
$$\frac{D T^{\mu\nu}}{D x^{\mu}} = \nabla_{\nu} T^{\mu \nu}=0.$$
row 0, energy; column 0, density; column 1-3, flow

Symmetric(from relarivistic field theory): $T^{0m} = T^{m0}$
Any component with a single lower index is, by convention, the component of a one-form;  
an upper index denotes the component of a vector.

When talking about gravitational-wave detectors, you normally use a sensitivity curve. This shows how sensitive it is at a given frequency: you plot a graph with the sensitivity curve on, and then plot the spectrum of the source you‚Äôre interested in on the same graph. If your source is above the sensitivity curve, you can detect it (yay), but if it lies below it, then you can‚Äôt pick it out from the noise (boo).

#### 
We find that the power spectra are best reconstructed at wavenumbers in the vicinity of k ‚âà $6 √ó 10^{‚àí4}$and $5 √ó 10^{‚àí3} Mpc^{‚àí1}$ , which correspond to the ‚Äúreionization bump‚Äù at $\ell < 6$ and ‚Äúrecombination bump‚Äù at $\ell$ ‚âà 80 of the CMB B-mode power spectrum, respectively

#### 1-22  [The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Detection of the Pairwise Kinematic Sunyaev-Zel‚Äôdovich Effect with SDSS DR15 Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08374.pdf)
**Mainly about kSZ, references therein**

As Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons traverse through a galaxy cluster they interact with the hot cluster gas, and the peculiar motion of the cluster relative to the CMB rest-frame creates a Doppler-shift in the CMB known as the **kinematic Sunyaev-Zel‚Äôdovich effect** (kSZ). Concurrently with the kSZ, the CMB photons are also heated up by the cluster gas, the **thermal Sunyaev-Zel‚Äôdovich effect (tSZ)**. The tSZ imprint has a characteristic frequency dependence, and can be isolated through the use of multi-frequency measurements. By contrast, the kSZ effect is an order of magnitude smaller and has a thermal spectrum which make its detection, and separation from tSZ and dust emission foregrounds, challenging.

On scales of the order of ‚àº25-50 Mpc, the gravitational attraction between clusters (and groups) of galaxies causes them, on average, to move towards each other. This pairwise motion can be used to extract the kSZ effect.

In addition to the pairwise statistics, other complementary techniques have also been applied to measure the kSZ effect [21], including velocity reconstruction [22] and projected fields [23, 24].

#### 1-22 [Simulation of the cosmic ray effects for the LiteBIRD satellite observing the CMB B-mode polarization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08410.pdf)

LiteBIRD will scan the **entire sky for three years** from the **second Lagrange point (L2) of the Sun-Earth system**. It is becoming a popular destination among astronomical satellites for providing a more thermally benign environment than near-Earth orbits. However, L2 is also known to provide a more harsh environment in terms of cosmic-ray (CR) radiation. CRs at L2 mainly consist of the Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) and Solar Energetic Particles (SEP). GCR is a permanent component with a hard spectrum, while SEP is an eruptive component with a soft spectrum associated with solar flares. Two major effects are anticipated in response to CR radiation: total-dose effects (TDE) and single event effects (SEE). Here, we consider SEE to the detector caused by GCR. SEP events are eruptive and small in a fraction of time, thus the data can be discarded during events similarly to Planck HFI.

#### 1-19  [Anomalous separations of the CMB temperature angular power spectrum](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.06731.pdf)

1. Cosmological data analysis in the past unveiled many **anomalies** in the observed CMB  patterns of WMAP and Planck. Such anomalies include the north-south power asymmetry [5], the anomalous cold spot ( [40], [14], [13]), high degree of octupolequadrupole alignment ( [39], [17], [38]), quadrupole power deficit ( [4], [24]) and planarity of the octupole [16], and the like. Some of the latter ones concerning the quadrupole and octupole have been somewhat mitigated using a hypothetical foreground reduction [1].
2. Anomalies, specifically those of the power excess for lower odd multipoles [30], have been shown to be a part of a more general trend in the observed maps ( [29], [3], [42]) referred to as a ‚Äòparity asymmetry‚Äô of the power distributed among low odd and even parity multipoles. Studies of the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect for low multipoles [15] help explain the power deficit in this range of multipoles.

#### 1-9 [1979 Nobel prize in physis](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1979/press-release/) -  **unified weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles**
The discovery of the radioactivity of certain heavy elements towards the end of last century, and the ensuing development of the physics of the atomic nucleus, led to the introduction of two new forces or interactions: the strong and the weak nuclear forces. Unlike gravitation and electromagnetism these forces act only at very short distances, of the order of nuclear diameters or less. While the strong interaction keeps protons and neutrons together in the nucleus, the weak interaction causes the so-called radioactive beta-decay. The typical process is the decay of the neutron: the neutron, with charge zero, is transformed into a positively charged proton, with the emission of a negatively charged electron and a neutral, massless particle, the neutrino.

#### 2021-1-7 [Neutrinos from Beta Processes in a Presupernova: Probing the Isotopic Evolution of a Massive Star](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa95c4)

The advanced evolution of massive stars‚Äîwhich culminates in their collapse, and possible explosion as supernovae‚Äîhas been observed so far only in the electromagnetic band. Completely different messengers, the neutrinos, dominate the star's energy loss from the core carbon-burning phase onward, and with their fast diffusion timescale, they set the very rapid pace (from months to hours) of the latest stages of nuclear fusion (presupernova). These neutrinos have never been detected; their observation in the future would offer a unique and direct probe of the physical processes that lead to stellar core collapse.

In a star's interior, neutrinos are produced via a number of thermal processes‚Äîmostly pair production‚Äîand via _Œ≤_-processes, i.e., electron/positron captures on nuclei and nuclear decay. The neutrino flux from thermal processes mainly depends on the thermodynamic conditions in the core. The neutrino flux from _Œ≤_ reactions has a stronger dependence on the isotopic composition, and thus on the complex network of nuclear reactions that take place in the star. In this respect, the two classes of production, thermal and _Œ≤_, carry complementary information.

#### 2021-1-8 [Reconstructing Patchy Reionization with Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01214.pdf)
1. Secondary anisotropies of CMB :weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structure,the various manifestations of the Sunyaev-Zel‚Äôdovich effect, which describe Compton scattering of CMB photons with free electrons in galaxy clusters and the intergalactic medium,the integrated Sachs-Wolfe and Rees-Sciama effects, characterizing how time-dependent gravitational potentials alter the energy of CMB photons; and the moving lens effect, where the transverse motion of massive objects imprints temperature fluctuations on the CMB.
2. Delensing.Delensing the CMB is useful beyond the benefits it provides for primordial gravitational wave searches. For example, delensing the temperature and E-mode polarization leads to sharper peaks in the power spectra, allowing for a better determination of parameters which impact peak positions. Delensing can also reduce the off-diagonal covariance induced by lensing  and thereby improve the sensitivity of the CMB to other effects, such as primordial non-Gaussianity.
3. Reionization, the process by which the neutral gas filling the Universe became ionized by the first stars and galaxies between redshifts of about 20 and 6, was a complex and non-uniform process. The spatial variations or patchiness in the process of reionization leads to effects on the observed CMB temperature and polarization. **Patchy reionization** can produce B-mode polarization, either by the modulation of E-mode polarization or by scattering of remote temperature quadrupoles, and these secondary B modes can potentially act as a source of confusion in searches for primordial gravitational waves.
4. The inhomogeneous nature of the reionization epoch causes several observable impacts on the CMB . The patchiness of reionization leads to an anisotropic optical depth whose effects on the CMB can be separated into three categories: screening, scattering, and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel‚Äôdovich effect. First, the variation of the optical depth on the sky, $œÑ (\hat{n})$, leads to a spatially dependent screening of CMB fluctuations due to the scattering of CMB photons into and out of our line of sight. Next, Thomson scattering of remote temperature quadrupoles on the free electrons in ionized bubbles generates new polarization fluctuations. Finally, the radial velocity of ionized bubbles generates CMB temperature fluctuations through the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel‚Äôdovich effect. For the purpose of this paper, we focus solely on the screening effect of patchy reionization, since we are interested in the **effect that can be reconstructed from observations of CMB polarization alone.** The scattering effect results in new polarization that is not correlated with the polarization generated at the surface of last scattering, and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel‚Äôdovich effect only produces temperature fluctuations.
5. Quadratic estimator. While the quadratic estimator works well with current data, it will be **sub-optimal** at the sensitivity anticipated in the next generation of CMB surveys. One reason for this is that higher order effects of the sources of secondary anisotropies become too important to ignore in very high fidelity CMB maps, and use of the quadratic estimator results in an estimate of the distortion field whose variance is limited by secondary anistropies rather than by instrumental noise.
