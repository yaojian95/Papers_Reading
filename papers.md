#### 1-22  [The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Detection of the Pairwise Kinematic Sunyaev-Zel’dovich Effect with SDSS DR15 Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08374.pdf)
**Mainly about kSZ, references therein**

As Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons traverse through a galaxy cluster they interact with the hot cluster gas, and the peculiar motion of the cluster relative to the CMB rest-frame creates a Doppler-shift in the CMB known as the **kinematic Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect** (kSZ). Concurrently with the kSZ, the CMB photons are also heated up by the cluster gas, the **thermal Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect (tSZ)**. The tSZ imprint has a characteristic frequency dependence, and can be isolated through the use of multi-frequency measurements. By contrast, the kSZ effect is an order of magnitude smaller and has a thermal spectrum which make its detection, and separation from tSZ and dust emission foregrounds, challenging.

On scales of the order of ∼25-50 Mpc, the gravitational attraction between clusters (and groups) of galaxies causes them, on average, to move towards each other. This pairwise motion can be used to extract the kSZ effect.

In addition to the pairwise statistics, other complementary techniques have also been applied to measure the kSZ effect [21], including velocity reconstruction [22] and projected fields [23, 24].

#### 1-22 [Simulation of the cosmic ray effects for the LiteBIRD satellite observing the CMB B-mode polarization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08410.pdf)

LiteBIRD will scan the **entire sky for three years** from the **second Lagrange point (L2) of the Sun-Earth system**. It is becoming a popular destination among astronomical satellites for providing a more thermally benign environment than near-Earth orbits. However, L2 is also known to provide a more harsh environment in terms of cosmic-ray (CR) radiation. CRs at L2 mainly consist of the Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) and Solar Energetic Particles (SEP). GCR is a permanent component with a hard spectrum, while SEP is an eruptive component with a soft spectrum associated with solar flares. Two major effects are anticipated in response to CR radiation: total-dose effects (TDE) and single event effects (SEE). Here, we consider SEE to the detector caused by GCR. SEP events are eruptive and small in a fraction of time, thus the data can be discarded during events similarly to Planck HFI.

#### 1-19  [Anomalous separations of the CMB temperature angular power spectrum](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.06731.pdf)

1. Cosmological data analysis in the past unveiled many **anomalies** in the observed CMB  patterns of WMAP and Planck. Such anomalies include the north-south power asymmetry [5], the anomalous cold spot ( [40], [14], [13]), high degree of octupolequadrupole alignment ( [39], [17], [38]), quadrupole power deficit ( [4], [24]) and planarity of the octupole [16], and the like. Some of the latter ones concerning the quadrupole and octupole have been somewhat mitigated using a hypothetical foreground reduction [1].
2. Anomalies, specifically those of the power excess for lower odd multipoles [30], have been shown to be a part of a more general trend in the observed maps ( [29], [3], [42]) referred to as a ‘parity asymmetry’ of the power distributed among low odd and even parity multipoles. Studies of the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect for low multipoles [15] help explain the power deficit in this range of multipoles.

#### 1-9 [1979 Nobel prize in physis](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1979/press-release/) -  **unified weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles**
The discovery of the radioactivity of certain heavy elements towards the end of last century, and the ensuing development of the physics of the atomic nucleus, led to the introduction of two new forces or interactions: the strong and the weak nuclear forces. Unlike gravitation and electromagnetism these forces act only at very short distances, of the order of nuclear diameters or less. While the strong interaction keeps protons and neutrons together in the nucleus, the weak interaction causes the so-called radioactive beta-decay. The typical process is the decay of the neutron: the neutron, with charge zero, is transformed into a positively charged proton, with the emission of a negatively charged electron and a neutral, massless particle, the neutrino.

对于自旋为半整数的粒子，不相容原理使它们不能聚集在同一个态上，这样可以导出它们满足一种被称为费米-狄拉克统计的统计规律，由此半整数自旋的粒子也被称为**费米子**。而对于自旋为整数的粒子，一个态上能聚集的粒子数没有限制，因此它们满足一种被称作玻色-爱因斯坦统计的统计规律，被称为**玻色子**。

#### 2021-1-7 [Neutrinos from Beta Processes in a Presupernova: Probing the Isotopic Evolution of a Massive Star](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa95c4)

The advanced evolution of massive stars—which culminates in their collapse, and possible explosion as supernovae—has been observed so far only in the electromagnetic band. Completely different messengers, the neutrinos, dominate the star's energy loss from the core carbon-burning phase onward, and with their fast diffusion timescale, they set the very rapid pace (from months to hours) of the latest stages of nuclear fusion (presupernova). These neutrinos have never been detected; their observation in the future would offer a unique and direct probe of the physical processes that lead to stellar core collapse.

In a star's interior, neutrinos are produced via a number of thermal processes—mostly pair production—and via _β_-processes, i.e., electron/positron captures on nuclei and nuclear decay. The neutrino flux from thermal processes mainly depends on the thermodynamic conditions in the core. The neutrino flux from _β_ reactions has a stronger dependence on the isotopic composition, and thus on the complex network of nuclear reactions that take place in the star. In this respect, the two classes of production, thermal and _β_, carry complementary information.

#### 2021-1-8 [Reconstructing Patchy Reionization with Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01214.pdf)
1. Secondary anisotropies of CMB :weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structure,the various manifestations of the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect, which describe Compton scattering of CMB photons with free electrons in galaxy clusters and the intergalactic medium,the integrated Sachs-Wolfe and Rees-Sciama effects, characterizing how time-dependent gravitational potentials alter the energy of CMB photons; and the moving lens effect, where the transverse motion of massive objects imprints temperature fluctuations on the CMB.
2. Delensing.Delensing the CMB is useful beyond the benefits it provides for primordial gravitational wave searches. For example, delensing the temperature and E-mode polarization leads to sharper peaks in the power spectra, allowing for a better determination of parameters which impact peak positions. Delensing can also reduce the off-diagonal covariance induced by lensing  and thereby improve the sensitivity of the CMB to other effects, such as primordial non-Gaussianity.
3. Reionization, the process by which the neutral gas filling the Universe became ionized by the first stars and galaxies between redshifts of about 20 and 6, was a complex and non-uniform process. The spatial variations or patchiness in the process of reionization leads to effects on the observed CMB temperature and polarization. **Patchy reionization** can produce B-mode polarization, either by the modulation of E-mode polarization or by scattering of remote temperature quadrupoles, and these secondary B modes can potentially act as a source of confusion in searches for primordial gravitational waves.
4. The inhomogeneous nature of the reionization epoch causes several observable impacts on the CMB . The patchiness of reionization leads to an anisotropic optical depth whose effects on the CMB can be separated into three categories: screening, scattering, and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect. First, the variation of the optical depth on the sky, $τ (\hat{n})$, leads to a spatially dependent screening of CMB fluctuations due to the scattering of CMB photons into and out of our line of sight. Next, Thomson scattering of remote temperature quadrupoles on the free electrons in ionized bubbles generates new polarization fluctuations. Finally, the radial velocity of ionized bubbles generates CMB temperature fluctuations through the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect. For the purpose of this paper, we focus solely on the screening effect of patchy reionization, since we are interested in the **effect that can be reconstructed from observations of CMB polarization alone.** The scattering effect results in new polarization that is not correlated with the polarization generated at the surface of last scattering, and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect only produces temperature fluctuations.
5. Quadratic estimator. While the quadratic estimator works well with current data, it will be **sub-optimal** at the sensitivity anticipated in the next generation of CMB surveys. One reason for this is that higher order effects of the sources of secondary anisotropies become too important to ignore in very high fidelity CMB maps, and use of the quadratic estimator results in an estimate of the distortion field whose variance is limited by secondary anistropies rather than by instrumental noise.
