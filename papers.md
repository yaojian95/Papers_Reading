In a star's interior, neutrinos are produced via a number of thermal processes—mostly pair production—and via _β_-processes, i.e., electron/positron captures on nuclei and nuclear decay.

1. Secondary anisotropies of CMB :weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structure,the various manifestations of the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect, which describe Compton scattering of CMB photons with free electrons in galaxy clusters and the intergalactic medium,the integrated Sachs-Wolfe and Rees-Sciama effects, characterizing how time-dependent gravitational potentials alter the energy of CMB photons; and the moving lens effect, where the transverse motion of massive objects imprints temperature fluctuations on the CMB.
2. Delensing.Delensing the CMB is useful beyond the benefits it provides for primordial gravitational wave searches. For example, delensing the temperature and E-mode polarization leads to sharper peaks in the power spectra, allowing for a better determination of parameters which impact peak positions. Delensing can also reduce the off-diagonal covariance induced by lensing  and thereby improve the sensitivity of the CMB to other effects, such as primordial non-Gaussianity.
